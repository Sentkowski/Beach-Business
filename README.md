# UI-Beach
A small strategy game based on concepts from theory of games.

The goal is to place shops to reach as many customers as possible â€“ and to earn money. There are two opponents which are the player's rivals.

## Rules
* Customers go to the closest store (to the one, to which the absolute value of the distance between the customers' sector and the store is the smallest).
* If there are two or three shops equally far, they share the profit, rounded down.
* Player order during each turn is random.
* There are 4-8 setors per turn.
* There are 0-90 customers in every sector.
